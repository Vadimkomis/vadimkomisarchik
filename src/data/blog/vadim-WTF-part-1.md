description: the post talks about me being better at focusing, and working the important things in my life and ignoring everything else

---


I’ve been thinking about this post for a while. I’m writing it for myself — to be brutally transparent, to stop hiding behind half-truths, and to cut the bullshit. I refuse to be vanilla. If I have weak spots, they’re going on the page. Writing exposes the things you pretend not to see. The Stoics understood that. So instead of looping the same thoughts like a broken record, I’m putting them down, publishing them, and moving forward.

My first draft was a long list of everything I’ve been avoiding. Over-complicated. So I scrapped it and went back to basics.

Hyper-focus on the task in front of you. Do it well. Be intentional with everything you do.
Hyper-focus isn’t complicated — it’s simple: one thing at a time. Keep your phone away. When a distraction hits, write it down and starve it. Delay the impulse, then make the work great.

And above all: be intentional. Know exactly what you want out of the next hour before you start. Cooking, lifting, coding, building — the aim has to be explicit. Pressure helps. Stress isn’t the enemy; wasted attention is.

My body is disciplined. My mind isn’t trained the same way. That changes now. Read consistently. Write about what I read. Do the things that feel heavy. Hard today becomes easy tomorrow.

When I release products, something clicks. That’s when I feel aligned — quiet, grounded, certain. Confidence comes from execution, not noise. The more I do, the less I talk. This post exists for one reason: I know what to do, and I’m still not doing it. So: WTF, Vadim.

I’m committing to a weekly public check-in. Two months. No negotiating with myself. Let’s see what happens when I actually push.

✌️
V.K.
