    Started as an iOS developer and then moved toward the management side, eventually serving as CTO.
    Today I’m working on my own products, searching for clear market signals and the right path to scale.

    Long term, I want to launch a biotech company focused on the brain.
    That ambition pushes me to keep exploring, learning, and pairing technical depth with product velocity.

    In my free time I enjoy comedy, staying fit (running ultras & lifting weights), and learning new things.

    I split my time between NYC and TLV, mostly NYC.
